# Technical Vision

Scalable | Modular | Accessible | Flexible | Decentralized

## [1] Enterprise-level blockchain solution
*Optimized blockchain technology built to scale and adapt to shifting needs.* 
- Moving away from pre-existing undelivered commitments designed by pre-fork teams.
- Optimizing the existing processes, including testing, patching and gap identification.
- Building in security mechanisms to address DPoS-related potential vulnerabilities. 
- Lowering the size of nodes and baseline infrastructure to promote robust scaling.

## [2] Expansive roster of maintained libraries and development tools
*Diverse libraries maintained by a group of decentralized developers.*
- Libraries managed by developers who have created them or have extensively modified them.
- Developer commitment and select library or code base.
- Documented development tools supported with recipes and community resources.
- Focus on ease of integration and ease of new development.

## [3] Layered solutions
*First and second layer of plugins that allow for functionality without adding bulk to the blockchain itself.*
- Modular plugins at blockchain, first, and second levels.
- Hivemind optimized to take on partial functionality of the `account_history` plugin.
- Second layer solutions delivering smart contracts, non-fungible tokens, and fungible tokens.
- Specialized microservices built upon existing technology to allow straightforward integration.

## [4] Decentralized redundancy
*Backup provisions to ensure lossless and continued operation of critical infrastructure.*
- Automatic failover in case of loss or compromise of primary key servers and nodes.
- Geographically distributed servers and nodes to prevent critical infrastructure-based attacks.
- Full utilization of and emphasis on the promotion of Open Source developed and incorporated solutions.
- Multiple key holders for critical points.
